However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, you can't actually read the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out the fields these tickets must have and the valid ranges for values in those fields.\n",

    "You collect the rules for ticket fields, the numbers on your ticket, and the numbers on other nearby tickets for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).\n",

    "The rules for ticket fields specify a list of fields that exist somewhere on the ticket and the valid ranges of values for each field. For example, a rule like class: 1-3 or 5-7 means that one of the fields in every ticket is named class and can be any value in the ranges 1-3 or 5-7 (inclusive, such that 3 and 5 are both valid in this field, but 4 is not).\n",

    "As your flight slowly drifts through the sky, the Elves at the Mythical Information Bureau at the North Pole contact you. They'd like some help debugging a malfunctioning experimental energy source aboard one of their super-secret imaging satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental energy source is based on cutting-edge technology: a set of Conway Cubes contained in a pocket dimension! When you hear it's having problems, you can't help but agree to take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z), there exists a single cube which is either active or inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start inactive. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes (your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified active (#) or inactive (.) state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy source then proceeds to boot up by executing six cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cube only ever considers its neighbors: any of the 26 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most 1. For example, given the cube at x=1,y=2,z=3, its neighbors include the cube at x=2,y=2,z=2, the cube at x=0,y=2,z=3, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a cycle, all cubes simultaneously change their state according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a cube is active and exactly 2 or 3 of its neighbors are also active, the cube remains active. Otherwise, the cube becomes inactive.\n",
    "    If a cube is inactive but exactly 3 of its neighbors are active, the cube becomes active. Otherwise, the cube remains inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineers responsible for this experimental energy source would like you to simulate the pocket dimension and determine what the configuration of cubes should be at the end of the six-cycle boot process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following initial state:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "```\n",

    "Even though the pocket dimension is 3-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1 region of the 3-dimensional space.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given z coordinate (and the frame of view follows the active cells in each cycle):\n",

    "The homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions that consist of addition (+), multiplication (*), and parentheses ((...)).

Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the product.\n",

    "You land in an airport surrounded by dense forest. As you walk to your high-speed train, the Elves at the Mythical Information Bureau contact you again. They think their satellite has collected an image of a sea monster! Unfortunately, the connection to the satellite is having problems, and many of the messages sent back from the satellite have been corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "They sent you a list of the rules valid messages should obey and a list of received messages they've collected so far (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for valid messages (the top part of your puzzle input) are numbered and build upon each other. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0: 1 2\n",
    "1: \"a\"\n",
    "2: 1 3 | 3 1\n",
    "3: \"b\"\n",

    "Some rules, like 3: \"b\", simply match a single character (in this case, b).\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining rules list the sub-rules that must be followed; for example, the rule 0: 1 2 means that to match rule 0, the text being checked must match rule 1, and the text after the part that matched rule 1 must then match rule 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the rules have multiple lists of sub-rules separated by a pipe (|). This means that at least one list of sub-rules must match. (The ones that match might be different each time the rule is encountered.) For example, the rule 2: 1 3 | 3 1 means that to match rule 2, the text being checked must match rule 1 followed by rule 3 or it must match rule 3 followed by rule 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are no loops in the rules, so the list of possible matches will be finite. Since rule 1 matches a and rule 3 matches b, rule 2 matches either ab or ba. Therefore, rule 0 matches aab or aba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more interesting example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0: 4 1 5\n",
    "1: 2 3 | 3 2\n",
    "2: 4 4 | 5 5\n",
    "3: 4 5 | 5 4\n",
    "4: \"a\"\n",
    "5: \"b\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, because rule 4 matches a and rule 5 matches b, rule 2 matches two letters that are the same (aa or bb), and rule 3 matches two letters that are different (ab or ba).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since rule 1 matches rules 2 and 3 once each in either order, it must match two pairs of letters, one pair with matching letters and one pair with different letters. This leaves eight possibilities: aaab, aaba, bbab, bbba, abaa, abbb, baaa, or babb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule 0, therefore, matches a (rule 4), then any of the eight options from rule 1, then b (rule 5): aaaabb, aaabab, abbabb, abbbab, aabaab, aabbbb, abaaab, or ababbb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The received messages (the bottom part of your puzzle input) need to be checked against the rules so you can determine which are valid and which are corrupted. Including the rules and the messages together, this might look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0: 4 1 5\n",
    "1: 2 3 | 3 2\n",
    "2: 4 4 | 5 5\n",

    "Recursive Combat still starts by splitting the cards into two decks (you offer to play with the same starting decks as before - it's only fair). Then, the game consists of a series of rounds with a few changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before either player deals a card, if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the same cards in the same order in the same players' decks, the game instantly ends in a win for player 1. Previous rounds from other games are not considered. (This prevents infinite games of Recursive Combat, which everyone agrees is a bad idea.)\n",
    "Otherwise, this round's cards must be in a new configuration; the players begin the round by each drawing the top card of their deck as normal.\n",
    "If both players have at least as many cards remaining in their deck as the value of the card they just drew, the winner of the round is determined by playing a new game of Recursive Combat (see below).\n",
    "Otherwise, at least one player must not have enough cards left in their deck to recurse; the winner of the round is the player with the higher-value card.\n",
    "As in regular Combat, the winner of the round (even if they won the round by winning a sub-game) takes the two cards dealt at the beginning of the round and places them on the bottom of their own deck (again so that the winner's card is above the other card). Note that the winner's card might be the lower-valued of the two cards if they won the round due to winning a sub-game. If collecting cards by winning the round causes a player to have all of the cards, they win, and the game ends.\n",

    "During a round of Recursive Combat, if both players have at least as many cards in their own decks as the number on the card they just dealt, the winner of the round is determined by recursing into a sub-game of Recursive Combat. (For example, if player 1 draws the 3 card, and player 2 draws the 7 card, this would occur if player 1 has at least 3 cards left and player 2 has at least 7 cards left, not counting the 3 and 7 cards that were drawn.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To play a sub-game of Recursive Combat, each player creates a new deck by making a copy of the next cards in their deck (the quantity of cards copied is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger the sub-game). During this sub-game, the game that triggered it is on hold and completely unaffected; no cards are removed from players' decks to form the sub-game.
